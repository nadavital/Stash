# Frontend Worktrees Playbook (v3, Component-First)

Use this playbook to move fast with parallel worktrees and near-zero merge conflicts.

## Locked visual source of truth

All UI work must match these files:

- `uiconcepts/homescreen.png`
- `uiconcepts/individualfolder.png`

Do not add visual concepts not present in these screens unless the user explicitly asks.

## Required skill

Every frontend worktree must use:
`[$stash-openai-ui](/Users/nadav/Desktop/Hackathon/skills/stash-openai-ui/SKILL.md)`

## Core strategy

1. Migrate from monolith (`public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`) to modular components.
2. Give each worktree exclusive file ownership.
3. Use one scaffold phase, one parallel phase, and one compose phase.
4. Merge in strict order.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Never work directly on local `main`.
2. Run preflight before editing:

```bash
pwd
git branch --show-current
git status --short
```

3. Frontend worktrees must not modify:
- `src/*`
- `mcp/*`
- `openclaw/*`
- `data/*.db*`

4. Keep branch names as `codex/wt-<name>`.
5. Ask the worktree-specific question pack before writing code.

## Target modular file layout

The scaffold branch creates this structure:

```text
public/
  index.html
  app/
    main.js
    router.js
    pages/
      home-page.js
      folder-page.js
    state/
      store.js
    services/
      api-client.js
      mappers.js
    components/
      topbar/
        topbar.js
      home-folder-grid/
        home-folder-grid.js
      home-recent-list/
        home-recent-list.js
      folder-hero-toolbar/
        folder-hero-toolbar.js
      folder-item-grid/
        folder-item-grid.js
      composer/
        composer.js
  styles/
    tokens.css
    base.css
    pages/
      home.css
      folder.css
    components/
      topbar.css
      home-folder-grid.css
      home-recent-list.css
      folder-hero-toolbar.css
      folder-item-grid.css
      composer.css
```

## Worktree plan

### Phase 1: Scaffold first (single worktree, no parallel edits yet)

Branch: `codex/wt-ui-shell`

Goal:
- Create modular folders/files above.
- Move existing monolith behavior into `pages/*`, `services/*`, and `state/*` scaffolds.
- Wire empty component placeholders so later branches only touch owned component files.

Owned files:
- `public/index.html`
- `public/app/main.js`
- `public/app/router.js`
- `public/app/pages/home-page.js`
- `public/app/pages/folder-page.js`
- `public/styles/tokens.css`
- `public/styles/base.css`
- `public/styles/pages/home.css`
- `public/styles/pages/folder.css`

Do not implement detailed component visuals here. Only shell + plumbing.

### Phase 2: Parallel component worktrees

Create all branches from latest `main` after `codex/wt-ui-shell` is merged.

#### A. Top bar

Branch: `codex/wt-ui-topbar`

Image slice:
- Top header row from both screens (logo/title, breadcrumb where relevant, search, settings).

Owned files:
- `public/app/components/topbar/topbar.js`
- `public/styles/components/topbar.css`

Question pack:
1. Should the home screen header text stay "Smart File Manager" or switch to "Stash"?
2. In folder view, should breadcrumb be clickable for each segment?
3. Keep settings as icon-only, or icon + label?

#### B. Home folder grid

Branch: `codex/wt-ui-home-folder-grid`

Image slice:
- Folder cards grid in `homescreen.png`.

Owned files:
- `public/app/components/home-folder-grid/home-folder-grid.js`
- `public/styles/components/home-folder-grid.css`

Question pack:
1. Should folder card count show exact counts from API or placeholder until loaded?
2. Keep three-dot menu visible always or on hover?
3. Should clicking a folder navigate immediately or single-click select + double-click open?

#### C. Home recent list

Branch: `codex/wt-ui-home-recent-list`

Image slice:
- "Recent Files" block in `homescreen.png`.

Owned files:
- `public/app/components/home-recent-list/home-recent-list.js`
- `public/styles/components/home-recent-list.css`

Question pack:
1. Max rows in recent list before scroll (e.g., 4, 6, 8)?
2. Show file type icon only, or icon + source badge?
3. Should row click open folder context directly?

#### D. Folder hero + toolbar

Branch: `codex/wt-ui-folder-hero-toolbar`

Image slice:
- Folder heading block + filter tabs + "New" action in `individualfolder.png`.

Owned files:
- `public/app/components/folder-hero-toolbar/folder-hero-toolbar.js`
- `public/styles/components/folder-hero-toolbar.css`

Question pack:
1. Keep tabs exactly `All / Images / Videos / Favorites` or map to memory types?
2. Should "New" open capture composer focus or a modal?
3. Should filter button open a dropdown or cycle preset filters?

#### E. Folder item grid

Branch: `codex/wt-ui-folder-item-grid`

Image slice:
- Main content cards grid in `individualfolder.png`.

Owned files:
- `public/app/components/folder-item-grid/folder-item-grid.js`
- `public/styles/components/folder-item-grid.css`

Question pack:
1. Keep metadata line as "Uploaded <time>" or use project-specific timestamps?
2. Show favorite star on selected cards only or persisted where tagged?
3. Should card menu be always visible or on hover?

#### F. Shared composer

Branch: `codex/wt-ui-composer`

Image slice:
- Bottom input bar from both screens.

Owned files:
- `public/app/components/composer/composer.js`
- `public/styles/components/composer.css`

Rules:
- No voice controls.
- Fixed structure: plus button, folder picker, text input, send action.

Question pack:
1. Placeholder copy for home vs folder view: same text or contextual text?
2. Send action style: icon-only or text button?
3. Plus button should open file picker immediately, or action menu?

#### G. Data adapter and state

Branch: `codex/wt-ui-adapter`

Owned files:
- `public/app/services/api-client.js`
- `public/app/services/mappers.js`
- `public/app/state/store.js`

Rules:
- No visual CSS changes.
- Support current backend + fallback mode.
- Expose stable page/view model shape to UI components.

Question pack:
1. Which folder ID/name should be default selected on initial load?
2. Should failed endpoints show stale cache or empty state first?
3. Confirm required fields for each card (title, preview, timestamp, tags).

### Phase 3: Compose/integration worktree

Branch: `codex/wt-ui-compose`

Goal:
- Import all component modules into pages.
- Ensure `home-page` and `folder-page` use components without file ownership violations.
- Final responsive pass and interaction glue.

Owned files:
- `public/app/main.js`
- `public/app/router.js`
- `public/app/pages/home-page.js`
- `public/app/pages/folder-page.js`
- `public/styles/base.css`
- `public/styles/pages/home.css`
- `public/styles/pages/folder.css`

Must not edit component-owned files.

## Merge order (strict)

1. Merge `codex/wt-ui-shell` to `main`.
2. Merge in any order:
- `codex/wt-ui-topbar`
- `codex/wt-ui-home-folder-grid`
- `codex/wt-ui-home-recent-list`
- `codex/wt-ui-folder-hero-toolbar`
- `codex/wt-ui-folder-item-grid`
- `codex/wt-ui-composer`
- `codex/wt-ui-adapter`
3. Merge `codex/wt-ui-compose` last.

## Per-worktree completion checklist

1. Only owned files changed.
2. Component matches only its assigned image slice.
3. Loading, empty, success, error states covered for the component.
4. Desktop + mobile sanity check done.
5. Handoff notes include any unanswered design questions.
