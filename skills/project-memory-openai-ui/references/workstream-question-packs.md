# Workstream Question Packs

Ask these questions before editing code. Keep wording specific and wait for answers.

## Shell and layout

1. Which first impression do you want: `single centered composer` or `three-surface dashboard`?
2. Should the top bar show only status and project scope, or also quick actions (`Recent`, `Projects`, `New memory`)?
3. Do you want project context switching as `chips`, `dropdown`, or `free text`?
4. Should onboarding emphasize `capture` first or `ask` first when the app is empty?
5. Which two moments should get animation emphasis: page load, save success, search refresh, or answer generation?
6. What should the heuristic fallback badge say exactly in your preferred tone?

## Capture experience

1. Should the capture surface use one unified composer or explicit source-type controls?
2. For link capture, do you want live URL preview before save or a minimal input flow?
3. After successful save, should content clear immediately or stay for rapid multi-save entry?
4. For image capture, do you want drag-and-drop now or file picker only?
5. Should save confirmation appear as inline message, toast, or optimistic insertion into stream?
6. Which validation behavior do you want for empty inputs: strict block or soft warning with guidance?

## Memory stream and retrieval

1. Default sort priority: `most recent`, `most relevant`, or `hybrid`?
2. Card density preference: `compact list` or `comfortable cards`?
3. Should full note details open in modal, inline expand, or dedicated panel?
4. Which metadata is highest value on card: project, source type, timestamp, or score?
5. Do you want search terms visually highlighted in results?
6. Should project filtering be chips, dropdown, or text input with suggestions?

## Ask and citations

1. Preferred answer style: `tight paragraph`, `bullets`, or `structured sections`?
2. Citation cards default: collapsed summaries or expanded snippets?
3. Should clicking a citation focus the related evidence card when available?
4. Should context brief generation stay in same answer panel or open dedicated panel?
5. Do you want explicit mode labels (`OpenAI`, `Fallback`, `Heuristic`) visible near each answer?
6. For unanswered questions, what copy style should we use: direct, exploratory, or action-oriented?

## Polish and QA

1. Which devices matter most for demo day: desktop-only, desktop+tablet, or full mobile parity?
2. Motion preference: minimal (`<120ms`), standard (`120-220ms`), or expressive (`220-320ms`)?
3. Which accessibility checks are required now: keyboard-only pass, color contrast pass, screen reader labels?
4. Should we include guided empty-state hints for demo prep in UI?
5. Any words to avoid in microcopy?
6. What level of visual boldness do you want: conservative, balanced, or daring?
